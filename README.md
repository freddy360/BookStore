# UNCC ITIS 3135 Webpage Project
The webpage is currently being hosted on my UNCC webpage at: https://webpages.charlotte.edu/borme/Project/index.html

This project was apart of my ITIS 3135 - Web-Based Application Design and Development class which I took my spring semster in 2023

The aim of this project was to find a client and create a website for their needs. I created a site for the Eta Rho chapter of the Delta Sigma Phi fraternity on campus at UNCC. The goal of the site is to display information about the fraternity and ways of getting in contact with them. As well as pratice web design techniques we learned throughout the semester.
